### Demo:

### Requirements:

In order to use this workflow you need:

- [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com "Alfred - Productivity App for Mac OS X") App.
- [Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/ "Boost your productivity even further with the Powerpack") addon for Alfred 2.

- [Firetask](http://www.firetask.com "Firetask: Project-oriented GTD Task Management for Mac OS X") App.

### Download:

Click [here](https://github.com/fbcom/alfred2firetask/archive/master.zip) to download the workflow as a zip file.

### Installation:

1. Unzip the downloaded file.
2. Double click on the workflow file to install it in Alfred or drag it onto the Alfred workflow screen.

### Usage:

Use the "**ft**" trigger to show the dialog to add tasks (see above gif):

1. Type "**ft** " followed by a description of what your new task is.
2. Hit [Enter] to add the task to Firetask.
3. Win \o/



### Advanced Usage:

You can use the following triggers:

- "**ftc**" to to add a task with *critical priority*.
- "**fth**" to to add a task with *high priority*.
- "**ftm**" to to add a task with *medium priority*.
- "**ftl**" to to add a task with *low priority*.
- "**ftt**" to to add a task with *trivial priority*.

In addition you can use any of the following modifiers:

- *priority:*
- *notes:*
- *category:*
- *project:*
- *due:*

to define the **priority**, **notes**, **category**, **project** and the **due** date of your task.

##### Example input using modifiers:
> **ft** buy a lemon **priority:** high **category:** Errands **project:** Fruity life **due:** 2015-05-10 **notes:** buy two, just in case

This adds a **"high priority"** task by the name of **"buy a lemon"** in the category **"Errands"** and project **"Fruity life"** with a due date of **"2015-05-10"** in your In-Tray.

##### Abbreviations for the modifiers are also available:
> **ft** buy a lemon **prio:** high **cat:** Errands **proj:** Fruity life **due:** 2015-05-10 **note:** now I want three

##### Note:

You don't need to use all modifiers at once. However the subject of the task must always be the first thing after the trigger. Also keep in mind that the names of projects and categories are case sensetive!
